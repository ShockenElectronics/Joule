# Joule
A new higher tech take on a robot suit, Joule will be a Synth based off Vader_San's open species. Joule will (hopefully) consist of 3 animated LED panels, two for eyes, one serving as a front status display to add emotions, as well as distance sensing, voice altering capabilities, and an amimated tail. Other parts include a full body suit with digigrtade feet to add to the look.
